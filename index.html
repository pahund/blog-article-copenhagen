    Hi, I'm Patrick, software engineer at mobile.de. My team and I work for <a href="http://www.mobile.de">mobile.de</a>, which is Germany's biggest online marketplace for cars and other vehicles.
</p>
<p>
    In June 2015, we were given a task that every software developer dreams of: throw away all the old stuff and rewrite everything from scratch. The “old stuff” being the public German home page of mobile.de, the main entry point of our platform.
</p>

<h3>mobile.de before...</h3>
<p>

</p>

<h3>...and after the relaunch</h3>
<p>

</p>

<h2>Why Node.js?</h2>

<p>We have, traditionally been a Java shop since we migrated from a big steaming pile of Perl back in 2007, but engineers at mobile.de are encouraged to explore new technologies and empowered to choose the best tool for the task at hand.</p>

<p>It was not hard to convince the Powers That Be<sup>TM</sup> that we should go for <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, although it was still fairly new technology for us.</p>

<p>At the time we started planning our team included four JavaScript experts (including myself) and two Java experts.</p>

<p>Our system architecture has evolved from monolithic to service-oriented in the last year or so. The new home page was to become a pretty simple web application, a thin layer between a handful of service APIs and the client-side code. Node.js is really good at integrating services and passing data through to the presentation layer, so it was an obvious choice.</p>

<h2>Our Build System</h2>
