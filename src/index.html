            Hi, I'm Patrick, software engineer at mobile.de. My team and I work on <a href="http://www.mobile.de">mobile.de</a>, which is Germany's biggest online marketplace for cars and other vehicles.
        </p>
        <p>
            In June 2015, we were given a task that every software developer dreams of: throw away all the old stuff and rewrite everything from scratch. The “old stuff” being the public German home page of mobile.de, the main entry point of our platform.

        <h2>Monitoring and Logging</h2>
        <p>
            We have roughly 7.29 unique users per month<sup>1</sup>, so the website gets a lot of traffic (about 40 requests per second). If we screw up, there's thousands people left out in the cold. So it's essential the the servers run smoothly – and if things do go awry, there is proper monitoring in place that immediately alerts us and proper logging to quickly find out what went wrong. My colleague <a href="http://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/jonykrause">Jonathan Krause</a> will go into detail on this in another blog article coming soon to this station.
